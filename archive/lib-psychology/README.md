| [How to Think Straight About Psychology](https://github.com/antomuto4/research-bs/blob/main/archive/lib-psychology/How_to_Think_Straight_About_Psychology_11th_Ed._2019.pdf) | Keith E. Stanovich | There exists a body of knowledge that is unknown to most people. This information concerns human behavior and consciousness in their various forms. It can be used to explain, predict, and control human actions. Those who have access to this knowledge use it to gain an understanding of other human beings. They have a more complete and accurate conception of what determines the behavior and thoughts of other individuals than do those who do not have this knowledge. Surprisingly enough, this unknown body of knowledge is the discipline of psychology. | 177 | 2019 |
| [Understanding Emotions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8zPFv03pmzsOERLMm5wY0hhajA/view) | Keltner, Dacher | Imagine you could flip a switch that would shut off your emotions. No more tongue-tiedembarrassment around a romantic interest. No more saying something in anger that you willregret. No more anxiety that interferes with your ability to do as well as you can. Would you flipthis switch? | 521 | 2018 |
| [Make it Stick (Demo)](https://github.com/antomuto4/research-bs/blob/main/archive/lib-psychology/MakeItStick.pdf) | Peter C. Brown | To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasted time and effort. Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners. | 18 | 2014 |
