| [How to Think Straight About Psychology](https://github.com/antomuto4/research-bs/blob/main/archive/lib-psychology/How_to_Think_Straight_About_Psychology_11th_Ed._2019.pdf) | Keith E. Stanovich | There exists a body of knowledge that is unknown to most people. This information concerns human behavior and consciousness in their various forms. It can be used to explain, predict, and control human actions. Those who have access to this knowledge use it to gain an understanding of other human beings. They have a more complete and accurate conception of what determines the behavior and thoughts of other individuals than do those who do not have this knowledge. Surprisingly enough, this unknown body of knowledge is the discipline of psychology. | 177 | 2019 |

The majority of us use some form of mind control such as persuasion or manipulation in our everyday lives to get what we want from others and to achieve our goals.

Mind control is a vast subject that has many components and factors to it and to get the proper understanding of it and the many techniques that are involved, it must be examined and explored in great detail. In his book entitled Banned Mind Control Techniques Unleashed author Daniel Smith covers in detail Mind Control and its associated techniques that are literally hidden away from the general public. You will learn about the dark secrets of hypnosis, manipulation, deception, persuasion, brainwashing and human psychology.
