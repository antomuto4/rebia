| [How to Think Straight About Psychology](https://github.com/antomuto4/research-bs/blob/main/archive/lib-psychology/How_to_Think_Straight_About_Psychology_11th_Ed._2019.pdf) | Keith E. Stanovich | There exists a body of knowledge that is unknown to most people. This information concerns human behavior and consciousness in their various forms. It can be used to explain, predict, and control human actions. Those who have access to this knowledge use it to gain an understanding of other human beings. They have a more complete and accurate conception of what determines the behavior and thoughts of other individuals than do those who do not have this knowledge. Surprisingly enough, this unknown body of knowledge is the discipline of psychology. | 177 | 2019 |

It all depends on the type of mind control that is involved and the intent of the individual who wants to apply it. It also depends on whether the target or subject of mind control will benefit from it or is harmed. Nonetheless, mind control is a very intriguing and fascinating topic. The majority of us use some form of mind control such as persuasion or manipulation in our everyday lives to get what we want from others and to achieve our goals. Some of us even have used the mind control technique of self hypnosis on ourselves for self improvement in the areas of weight loss, reducing stress levels, or eradicating bad habits such as smoking from our lives. Mind control is a vast subject that has many components and factors to it and to get the proper understanding of it and the many techniques that are involved, it must be examined and explored in great detail. In his book entitled Banned Mind Control Techniques Unleashed author Daniel Smith covers in detail Mind Control and its associated techniques that are literally hidden away from the general public. You will learn about the dark secrets of hypnosis, manipulation, deception, persuasion, brainwashing and human psychology. After reading this book you will have a deeper understanding of mind control and its core principles. You will also have the information that you need to use mind control on others or stop others from using mind control on you! | 361 | 2014 |
