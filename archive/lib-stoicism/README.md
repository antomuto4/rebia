| [How to Be Free: An Ancient Guide to the Stoic Life - Introduction](https://github.com/antomuto4/research-bs/blob/main/archive/lib-stoicism/How%20to%20Be%20Free:%20An%20Ancient%20Guide%20to%20the%20Stoic%20Life.pdf) | Epictetus | Born a slave, the Roman Stoic philosopher Epictetus (c. 55–135 AD) taught that mental freedom is supreme, since it can liberate one anywhere, even in a prison. In How to Be Free, A. A. Long―one of the world’s leading authorities on Stoicism and a pioneer in its remarkable contemporary revival―provides a superb new edition of Epictetus’s celebrated guide to the Stoic philosophy of life (the Encheiridion) along with a selection of related reflections in his Discourses. | 40 | 2018 |
| [Philosophy as a Way of Life: Spiritual Exercises from Socrates to Foucault](https://github.com/antomuto4/research-bs/blob/main/archive/lib-stoicism/pierre-hadot-philosophy-as-a-way-of-life-spiritual-exercises-from-socrates-to-foucault-1.pdf) | Pierre Hadot | This book presents a history of spiritual exercises from Socrates to early Christianity, an account of their decline in modern philosophy, and a discussion of the different conceptions of philosophy that have accompanied the trajectory and fate of the theory and practice of spiritual exercises. Hadot's book demonstrates the extent to which philosophy has been, and still is, above all else a way of seeing and of being in the world. | 321 | 1981 |
