| [Is Crynoics an Ethical Means of Life Extension?](https://github.com/antomuto4/research-bs/blob/main/archive/lib-immortality/CROICA-2.2.pdf) | Rebekah Cron | Biologists have known for some time that certain organisms can survive for sustained time periods in what is essentially a death"like state. The North American Wood Frog, for example, shuts down its entire body system in winter; its heart stops beating and its whole body is frozen, until summer returns; at which point it thaws and ‘comes back to life’ What is now becoming clear is that there is a technology available for humans that imitates this process. What if we, like the frog, could be ‘frozen’ until a period of time in which developing technology could cure our ailments, prolong our lives, and possibly allow us to live forever? | 29 | 2014 |
